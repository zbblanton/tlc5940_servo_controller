# TLC5940 Servo Controller for PIC Micrcontrollers

Verison 1.0 is ready for download. It still lacks some documentation of the functions, but should work on any of the 
PIC18 series microcontrollers. This verison is only for the brave or impatient souls who can't wait for better documentation.
Verison 1.1 will have fully documented code and a few great new functions that I think will separate this library from others.

This code is developed and tested on the PIC18F4520.
