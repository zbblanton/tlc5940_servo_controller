# TLC5940 Servo Controller for PIC Microcontrollers

Version 1.0 is ready for download. It still lacks some documentation of the functions, but should work on any of the 
PIC18 series microcontrollers. This version is only for the brave or impatient souls who can't wait for better documentation.
Version 1.1 will have fully documented code and a few great new functions that I think will separate this library from others.

To download the source, go to downloads and click "tlc5940_servo_controller_v1.0.zip".

I should be able to release version 1.1 by the end of this week, so around 7/5/2014. This verison should be fully documented
and I will then be able to release a full tutorial on how to wire the TLC5940 up and how to use the functions.

This code is developed and tested on the PIC18F4520.
